#### Binary Numbers
In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically 0 (zero) and 1 (one).

The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.

Any number can be represented by a sequence of bits.

0001 - 1
1000 - 8
1111 - 15
11111111 - 255

#### ASCII
**American Standard Code for Information Interchange** is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

* 128 specified characters
* digits, 0-9 a-z_A-Z, and punctuation symbols, and 33 non printing codes (tab, carriage return)
* uses 7 bit integers to represent the characters

#### Unicode
Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. Unicode 11.0, contains a repertoire of 137,439 characters covering 146 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets and emoji.

The Unicode standard defines UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, and several other encodings are in use. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16, and UCS-2, a precursor of UTF-16.

#### Pseudocode
Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm. It uses the structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. No standard for pseudocode syntax exists, as a program in pseudocode is not an executable program.
